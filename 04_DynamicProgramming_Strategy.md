# üß† Dynamic Programming: The Amazon Strategy Optimizer

## üéØ Mental Model: The "Amazon Business Intelligence" Framework

Think of DP like **Amazon's strategic decision-making process** - learning from past decisions to optimize future outcomes, avoiding redundant calculations, and building solutions incrementally.

## üß† Cognitive Frameworks for DP

### The "Amazon Decision Tree" Model
```
Every DP problem = Strategic business decision

Question Framework:
1. What are my OPTIONS at each step?
   (Recurrence relation)
   
2. What INFORMATION do I need to make decisions?
   (State variables)
   
3. What's the GOAL I'm optimizing for?
   (Objective function)
   
4. What are the BASE CASES?
   (Boundary conditions)
   
5. Can I REUSE previous calculations?
   (Memoization opportunity)
```

### The "AWS Cost Optimization" Analogy
```python
def aws_resource_optimization_mindset():
    """
    DP Thinking = AWS Cost Optimization

       - Baseline requirements
    
    2. CACHE CALCULATIONS
       - Don't recalculate instance costs
       - Store optimization results
       - Reuse configuration templates
    
    3. BUILD INCREMENTALLY
       - Start with basic setup
       - Add optimizations layer by layer
       - Scale based on proven patterns
    
    4. AVOID REDUNDANCY
       - Don't spin up duplicate resources
       - Share common infrastructure
