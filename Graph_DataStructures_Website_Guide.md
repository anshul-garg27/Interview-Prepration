## 🎯 Introduction to Graphs {#introduction}

### What is a Graph?

A **Graph** is like a network of cities connected by roads. Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles and multiple paths between nodes. They represent relationships and connections in the real world.

```
Real-World Graph Example:
    A ---- B
    |    / |
    |   /  |
    |  /   |
    C ---- D

- Vertices/Nodes: A, B, C, D (the cities)
- Edges: A-B, A-C, B-C, B-D, C-D (the roads)
- Degree of B: 3 (connected to A, C, D)
- Path from A to D: A → B → D or A → C → D
- Cycle: A → B → C → A
```

### 🌍 Real-World Applications

| Domain | Example | Graph Elements |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Social Media** | Facebook Friends | People = Vertices, Friendships = Edges |
| **Navigation** | Google Maps | Cities = Vertices, Roads = Edges |
| **Internet** | Web Pages | Pages = Vertices, Links = Edges |
| **Biology** | Protein Networks | Proteins = Vertices, Interactions = Edges |
| **Computer Networks** | Router Topology | Routers = Vertices, Connections = Edges |

### Types of Graphs

#### 1. **Directed vs Undirected**

```
Undirected Graph:         Directed Graph (Digraph):
A ---- B                  A ----> B
|      |                  |       ↓
|      |                  ↓       |
C ---- D                  C ----> D

Edges have no direction   Edges have direction (arrows)
```

```python
# Undirected Graph
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'C', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'B', 'D'],
    'D': ['B', 'C']
}

# Directed Graph
directed_graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D'],
    'C': ['D'],
    'D': []
}
```

#### 2. **Weighted vs Unweighted**

```
Unweighted:               Weighted:
A ---- B                  A --5-- B
|      |                  |       |
|      |                  3       2
|      |                  |       |
C ---- D                  C --1-- D

All edges equal           Edges have costs/weights
```

```python
# Unweighted
unweighted = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D']
}

# Weighted
weighted = {
    'A': [('B', 5), ('C', 3)],
    'B': [('A', 5), ('D', 2)]
}
```

#### 3. **Cyclic vs Acyclic**

```
Cyclic Graph:             Acyclic Graph (DAG):
A ---- B                  A ----> B
|      |                  |       ↓
|      |                  ↓       |
C ---- D                  C       D
 \    /
  \  /
   \/
   
Contains cycles           No cycles (Directed Acyclic Graph)
```

### Graph Properties

- **Degree**: Number of edges connected to a vertex
- **Path**: Sequence of vertices connected by edges
- **Cycle**: Path that starts and ends at the same vertex
- **Connected**: Every vertex reachable from every other vertex
- **Component**: Maximal connected subgraph

## 🏗️ Graph Representations {#representations}

### 1. Adjacency List (Most Common)

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}
    
    def add_vertex(self, vertex):
        if vertex not in self.graph:
            self.graph[vertex] = []
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        self.add_vertex(u)
        self.add_vertex(v)
        self.graph[u].append((v, weight))
    
    def display(self):
        for vertex in self.graph:
            print(f"{vertex}: {self.graph[vertex]}")

# Example Usage
g = Graph()
g.add_edge('A', 'B', 5)
g.add_edge('A', 'C', 3)
g.add_edge('B', 'D', 2)
g.display()
# Output:
# A: [('B', 5), ('C', 3)]
# B: [('D', 2)]
# C: []
# D: []
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Add vertex: O(1)
- Add edge: O(1)
- Check edge: O(V)
- Space: O(V + E)

### 2. Adjacency Matrix

```python
class GraphMatrix:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.matrix = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
        self.vertices = {}
        self.vertex_count = 0
    
    def add_vertex(self, vertex):
        if vertex not in self.vertices:
            self.vertices[vertex] = self.vertex_count
            self.vertex_count += 1
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        self.add_vertex(u)
        self.add_vertex(v)
        u_idx = self.vertices[u]
        v_idx = self.vertices[v]
        self.matrix[u_idx][v_idx] = weight
    
    def display(self):
        print("Adjacency Matrix:")
        for row in self.matrix:
            print(row)

# Example Usage
gm = GraphMatrix(4)
gm.add_edge('A', 'B', 5)
gm.add_edge('A', 'C', 3)
gm.display()
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Add vertex: O(1)
- Add edge: O(1)
- Check edge: O(1)
- Space: O(V²)

### When to Use Which?

| Operation | Adjacency List | Adjacency Matrix |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Dense Graphs** | ❌ More memory | ✅ Efficient |
| **Sparse Graphs** | ✅ Memory efficient | ❌ Wasteful |
| **Edge Lookup** | O(V) | O(1) |
| **Add Edge** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Space** | O(V + E) | O(V²) |

## ⚙️ Algorithm Steps & Execution {#algorithm-steps}

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Algorithm Analysis

Understanding how graph algorithms work internally is crucial for:
- **Debugging** your implementations
- **Optimizing** performance
- **Handling edge cases**
- **Interview explanations**

#### Example Graph for All Demonstrations:
```

Adjacency List:
A: [(B,5), (C,3)]
B: [(A,5), (C,2), (D,1)]
C: [(A,3), (B,2), (D,1)]
D: [(B,1), (C,1)]
```

### 📋 Generic Algorithm Steps Template

```python
def generic_graph_algorithm(graph, start):
    """
    Universal template for graph algorithms
    """
    # STEP 1: Initialize data structures
    visited = set()
    data_structure = []  # Queue for BFS, Stack for DFS, PriorityQueue for Dijkstra
    result = []
    
    # STEP 2: Add starting vertex
    data_structure.append(start)
    
    # STEP 3: Main algorithm loop
    while data_structure:
        # STEP 3a: Get next vertex to process
        current = data_structure.pop()  # or popleft() for BFS

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - Step by Step

#### 🎯 When to Use BFS:
- ✅ **Shortest path** in unweighted graphs
- ✅ **Level-order traversal**
- ✅ **Finding minimum steps**
- ✅ **Social network analysis** (degrees of separation)

#### 📝 BFS Algorithm Steps:

```
STEP 1: Initialize queue and visited set

            # Add neighbors
            neighbors_added = []
            for neighbor in graph.get(current, []):
                if neighbor not in visited and neighbor not in queue:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    neighbors_added.append(neighbor)
            
            if neighbors_added:

        print(f"   📊 Queue: {list(queue)}, Visited: {visited}")
        print("-" * 30)
        step += 1
    
    print(f"🏁 BFS Complete! Final result: {result}")
    return result

# Example execution
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

bfs_result = bfs_with_steps(graph, 'A')
```

**Output:**
```
🚀 Starting BFS from A
📊 Initial: Queue = ['A'], Visited = set()
==================================================
📍 STEP 1:
   Dequeue: A
   ✅ Visit A → Result: ['A']
   ➕ Added neighbors: ['B', 'C']
   📊 Queue: ['B', 'C'], Visited: {'A'}
------------------------------
📍 STEP 2:
   Dequeue: B
   ✅ Visit B → Result: ['A', 'B']
   ➕ Added neighbors: ['D', 'E']
   📊 Queue: ['C', 'D', 'E'], Visited: {'A', 'B'}

#### 📊 BFS Visual Execution:

```
Graph:    A ---- B ---- D
          |      |
          |      |
          C ---- F ---- E

Level 0:  [A] ← Start here
Level 1:  [B, C] ← A's neighbors  
Level 2:  [D, E, F] ← B and C's neighbors
Level 3:  [] ← D, E, F have no new neighbors

BFS visits level by level: A → B → C → D → E → F
```

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS) - Step by Step

#### 🎯 When to Use DFS:
- ✅ **Cycle detection**
- ✅ **Topological sorting**
- ✅ **Finding connected components**
- ✅ **Path finding** (any path, not shortest)
- ✅ **Memory efficient** (uses less memory than BFS)

#### 📝 DFS Algorithm Steps:

```
STEP 1: Initialize stack and visited set
STEP 2: Add starting vertex to stack
STEP 3: While stack is not empty:
   3a: Pop top vertex
   3b: If not visited, mark as visited
   3c: Process vertex (add to result)
   3d: Add all unvisited neighbors to stack
STEP 4: Return result
```

## 🎯 Common Graph Patterns {#patterns}

### Pattern 1: Island Problems

**Template for grid-based graph problems:**

```python
def count_islands(grid):
    """
    Count number of islands in a 2D grid
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = set()
    count = 0
    
    def dfs(r, c):
        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == '0':
            return
        
        visited.add((r, c))
        # Check all 4 directions
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

            dfs(r + dr, c + dc)
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                dfs(r, c)
                count += 1
    
    return count

# Example
grid = [
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '1', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1']
]

print(f"Number of islands: {count_islands(grid)}")  # 3
```

### Pattern 2: Clone Graph

```python

        if node in cloned:
            return cloned[node]
        
        clone = Node(node.val)
        cloned[node] = clone
        
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            clone.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
        
        return clone
    
    return dfs(node)
```

### Pattern 3: Bipartite Graph Check

```python

    """
    Check if graph is bipartite using BFS coloring

        if vertex not in color:
            if not bfs(vertex):
                return False
    
    return True

# Example

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Best Practices {#pitfalls}

### 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### 1. **Forgetting to Handle Disconnected Components**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Only explores from starting node
def wrong_dfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
    
    dfs(start)
    return len(visited)  # Only counts connected component!

# ✅ CORRECT: Handles all components
def correct_dfs_all_components(graph):
    visited = set()
    components = 0
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
            components += 1
    
    return components
```

#### 2. **Infinite Loops in Cyclic Graphs**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: No visited tracking
def wrong_path_exists(graph, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return True
    
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if wrong_path_exists(graph, neighbor, end):  # INFINITE LOOP!
            return True
    
    return False

# ✅ CORRECT: Proper visited tracking
def correct_path_exists(graph, start, end, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    
    if start == end:
        return True
    
    visited.add(start)
    
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            if correct_path_exists(graph, neighbor, end, visited):
                return True
    
    return False
```

#### 3. **Wrong BFS Implementation**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Using regular list instead of deque
def wrong_bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = [start]  # WRONG: list.pop(0) is O(n)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)  # O(n) operation!
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node])
    
    return visited

# ✅ CORRECT: Using deque for O(1) operations
from collections import deque

def correct_bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])  # CORRECT: deque for O(1) popleft()
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()  # O(1) operation
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited
```

#### 4. **Dijkstra with Negative Weights**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Using Dijkstra for negative weights
def wrong_shortest_path_negative():
    """
    Dijkstra FAILS with negative weights!
    
    Example:
    A --1--> B
    |        |
    5        -10
    |        |
    v        v
    C -------> D
           2
    
    Dijkstra thinks A->B->D = 1 + (-10) = -9
    But A->C->D = 5 + 2 = 7
    So it chooses A->B->D
    
    But what if there's another path A->C->B->D = 5 + ? + (-10) = ?
    Dijkstra won't explore this because it already "finalized" B!
    """
    pass

# ✅ CORRECT: Use Bellman-Ford for negative weights
def correct_negative_weights(graph, start):
    return bellman_ford(graph, start)
```

#### 5. **Undirected Graph Cycle Detection Error**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Treating undirected as directed
def wrong_cycle_detection(graph):

                return True
        return False
    
    return any(dfs(node, None) for node in graph if node not in visited)
```

### ✅ Best Practices & Do's

#### 1. **Always Validate Input**

```python
def robust_bfs(graph, start):
    """Production-ready BFS with input validation"""
    # Input validation
    if not graph:
        raise ValueError("Graph cannot be empty")
    
    if start not in graph:
        raise ValueError(f"Start node {start} not in graph")
    
    # Handle edge cases
    if not graph[start]:  # No neighbors
        return [start]
    
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    result = []
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            result.append(node)
            
            # Validate neighbors exist
            for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
                if neighbor in graph and neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return result
```

#### 2. **Use Appropriate Data Structures**

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Choose right data structure for the job
class OptimalGraph:
    def __init__(self, representation='adjacency_list'):
        if representation == 'adjacency_list':
            self.graph = {}  # Good for sparse graphs
        elif representation == 'adjacency_matrix':
            self.matrix = []  # Good for dense graphs
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid representation")
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        if hasattr(self, 'graph'):
            # Adjacency list: O(1) add, O(V) lookup
            if u not in self.graph:
                self.graph[u] = []
            self.graph[u].append((v, weight))
        else:
            # Adjacency matrix: O(1) add, O(1) lookup
            # Requires pre-allocated matrix
            pass
```

#### 3. **Memory Management for Large Graphs**

```python
def memory_efficient_dfs(graph, start):
    """Iterative DFS to avoid stack overflow"""
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            
            # Process in reverse order for consistent traversal
            neighbors = list(graph.get(node, []))
            for neighbor in reversed(neighbors):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited
```

#### 4. **Clear Documentation & Comments**

```python
def dijkstra_documented(graph, start):
    """
    Find shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    
    Args:
        graph: Dict[str, List[Tuple[str, int]]] - Adjacency list with weights
        start: str - Starting vertex
    
    Returns:
        Tuple[Dict[str, int], Dict[str, str]] - (distances, previous_vertices)
    
    Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) with binary heap
    Space Complexity: O(V)
    
    Preconditions:
        - Graph has no negative weights
        - Start vertex exists in graph
    
    Example:
        >>> graph = {'A': [('B', 2)], 'B': []}
        >>> distances, previous = dijkstra_documented(graph, 'A')
        >>> distances['B']
        2
    """
    import heapq
    
    # Initialize distances to infinity
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    
    # Priority queue: (distance, vertex)
    pq = [(0, start)]
    previous = {}
    visited = set()
    
    while pq:
        # Get vertex with smallest distance
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # Skip if already processed (handles duplicate entries)
        if current_vertex in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add(current_vertex)
        
        # Relax all edges from current vertex
        for neighbor, weight in graph.get(current_vertex, []):
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            # If shorter path found, update
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous[neighbor] = current_vertex
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances, previous
```

#### 5. **Comprehensive Testing**

```python
def test_graph_algorithms():
    """Comprehensive test suite for graph algorithms"""
    
    # Test Case 1: Empty graph
    assert bfs({}, 'A') == [], "Empty graph should return empty result"
    
    # Test Case 2: Single node
    single_node = {'A': []}
    assert bfs(single_node, 'A') == ['A'], "Single node should return itself"
    
    # Test Case 3: Disconnected components
    disconnected = {
        'A': ['B'],
        'B': ['A'],
        'C': ['D'],
        'D': ['C']
    }
    result = bfs(disconnected, 'A')
    assert 'C' not in result, "Should not reach disconnected components"
    
    # Test Case 4: Cyclic graph
    cyclic = {
        'A': ['B'],
        'B': ['C'],
        'C': ['A']
    }
    result = bfs(cyclic, 'A')
    assert len(result) == 3, "Should visit all nodes in cycle exactly once"
    
    print("✅ All tests passed!")

test_graph_algorithms()
```

### 🎯 Performance Optimization Tips

#### 1. **Choose Right Algorithm for Problem**

```python
# Decision Matrix
def choose_algorithm(problem_type):
    """
    Algorithm selection guide based on problem requirements
    """
    if problem_type == "shortest_path":
        return "Dijkstra"  # Single source, non-negative weights
    elif problem_type == "any_path":
        return "DFS"  # Faster to find any solution
    elif problem_type == "cycle_detection":
        return "DFS_with_colors"  # White-Gray-Black coloring
    elif problem_type == "connected_components":
        return "Union_Find_or_DFS"  # Both work, DFS more memory efficient
    elif problem_type == "maze_solving":
        return "DFS"  # Natural backtracking
    elif problem_type == "social_network_analysis":
        return "BFS"  # Level-based relationships
    elif problem_type == "dependency_resolution":
        return "DFS"  # Natural recursive structure
    ```

#### 2. **Early Termination Strategies**

```python
def optimized_path_search(graph, start, end):
    """BFS with early termination when target found"""
    if start == end:
        return [start]
    
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    
    while queue:
        node, path = queue.popleft()
        
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor == end:
                return path + [neighbor]  # EARLY TERMINATION!
            
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    
    return None  # No path found
```

### 📊 Common Interview Mistakes & Solutions

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Forgetting visited set** | Infinite loops | Always track visited nodes |
| **Wrong data structure** | Inefficient operations | Use deque for BFS, not list |
| **Ignoring edge cases** | Bugs in corner cases | Test empty graphs, single nodes, cycles |
| **Modifying graph during traversal** | Unexpected behavior | Work on copy or use careful state management |
| **Stack overflow in deep graphs** | Runtime error | Use iterative approach for very deep graphs |
| **Not considering edge cases** | Bugs in corner cases | Test empty graphs, single nodes, cycles |

### 🎯 Interview Strategy & Tips

#### **Problem-Solving Approach**

1. **Identify Graph Type**
   ```
   ❓ Questions to Ask:
   - Directed or undirected?
   - Weighted or unweighted?
   - Dense or sparse?
   - Cyclic or acyclic?
   ```

2. **Choose Representation**
   ```python
   # Adjacency List (most common)
   graph = {'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['A'], 'C': ['A']}
   
   # Adjacency Matrix (dense graphs)
   matrix = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]
   
   # Edge List (simple operations)
   edges = [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C')]
   ```

3. **Select Algorithm**
   ```python
   def select_algorithm(problem_type):
       if problem_type == "shortest_path":
           return "Dijkstra"  # Single source, non-negative weights
       elif problem_type == "any_path":
           return "DFS"  # Faster to find any solution
       elif problem_type == "cycle_detection":
           return "DFS_with_colors"  # White-Gray-Black coloring
       elif problem_type == "connected_components":
           return "Union_Find_or_DFS"  # Both work, DFS more memory efficient
       elif problem_type == "maze_solving":
           return "DFS"  # Natural backtracking
       elif problem_type == "social_network_analysis":
           return "BFS"  # Level-based relationships
       elif problem_type == "dependency_resolution":
           return "DFS"  # Natural recursive structure
   ```

#### **Common Interview Mistakes**

❌ **Don't Do:**
- Forget to handle disconnected components
- Use wrong data structure (list instead of deque for BFS)
- Ignore cycle detection in traversal
- Forget to validate input parameters
- Mix up directed vs undirected graph logic

✅ **Do:**
- Start with clarifying questions
- Draw the graph structure
- Trace through algorithm with examples
- Consider edge cases (empty graph, single node)
- Optimize after getting correct solution
